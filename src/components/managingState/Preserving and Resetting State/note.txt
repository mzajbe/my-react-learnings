let className = 'counter';
  if (hover) {
    className += ' hover';
  }
why += use there ??


=> 


In the code you provided, className += ' hover' is used to conditionally add a CSS class to an element based on the hover state. Let me explain how this works:

Initially, className is set to 'counter'.

When the hover state is true (which happens when the pointer enters the element), the code appends ' hover' to the existing className.

The += operator is the addition assignment operator - it takes the current value of className and adds ' hover' to it.

So if hover is true, the final className becomes 'counter hover' (two classes separated by a space), and if hover is false, it remains just 'counter'.

This is a common pattern in React for conditionally applying CSS classes. The corresponding CSS would then have styles for both cases:

.counter (normal state)

.counter.hover or .counter.hover (hover state styles)

The += is used instead of simply = because we want to add to the existing class list rather than replace it entirely. If we used className = 'hover' instead, we would lose the original 'counter' class.

In modern React, you might also see this done with libraries like classnames or using template literals:


className = `counter ${hover ? 'hover' : ''}`
But the += approach works fine for simple cases like this one.
